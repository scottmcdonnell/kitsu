## Code contributions

Of course, we enjoy receiving code contributions.

feature requests on our Canny page.

The Kitsu code is written with JavaScript (ES6+) and is based on the 
[Vue.js](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/) framework extended with 
the [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) plugin.

To install the development environment, follow [the dedicated guide](https://kitsu.cg-wire.com/installation/#development-environment).
